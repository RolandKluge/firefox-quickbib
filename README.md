# firefox-quickbib
A tiny firefox extension for quickly retrieving BibTeX references.

Currently, only Springer link is supported.

## How to use
1. Go to the site corresponding to a particular paper, e.g., http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-31491-9_10
2. Select 'Tools/Open BibTeX'
3. Firefox will open the link to the BibTeX file in a new tab, e.g., http://link.springer.com/export-citation/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-31491-9_10.bib  
    - If you rather like to open the BibTeX code immediately in the browser, you may find the addin 'Open in Browser' helpful.
